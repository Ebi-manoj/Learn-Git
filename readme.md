# üß† Important Git Terms to Know Before Getting Started

| Term                     | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository (repo)**    | A project folder tracked by Git. Can be local or hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, etc.                         |
| **Working Directory**    | The actual files and folders you‚Äôre currently working on in your system.                                               |
| **Staging Area (Index)** | A place where changes are added (`git add`) before they are committed. Think of it as a ‚Äúpreview‚Äù of your next commit. |
| **Commit**               | A snapshot of the staged changes. Commits include a unique ID and message.                                             |
| **HEAD**                 | A pointer to the latest commit in the current branch.                                                                  |
| **Branch**               | A lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Used to develop features independently from the main codebase.              |
| **Merge**                | Combine changes from one branch into another. Typically done to integrate feature branches into the main branch.       |
| **Conflict**             | Happens when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two branches. Must be resolved manually.             |
| **Clone**                | Copy of a remote repository to your local machine (`git clone`).                                                       |
| **Pull**                 | Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your current branch (`git pull`).                                |
| **Push**                 | Upload local commits to the remote repository (`git push`).                                                            |
| **Remote**               | A version of your repository hosted on the internet or network (e.g., GitHub).                                         |
| **Fork**                 | A personal copy of someone else's repository, typically used for proposing changes.                                    |
| **Stage (Staged)**       | Files added to the staging area using `git add` and ready to be committed.                                             |
| **Unstage**              | Removing files from the staging area using `git restore --staged`. Changes remain in working directory.                |
| **Revert**               | Creates a new commit that undoes changes of a previous commit without modifying the history.                           |
| **Reset**                | Moves HEAD and optionally modifies staging/working directory. Can delete commit history if used carelessly.            |
| **Checkout**             | Switch branches or restore files (`git checkout`).                                                                     |
| **Rebase**               | Reapplies commits on top of another base commit to create a cleaner project history.                                   |
| **Tag**                  | A reference to a specific commit, often used for marking releases (`v1.0.0`).                                          |
| **Stash**                | Temporarily saves uncommitted changes for later use (`git stash`). Useful when switching branches without committing.  |
| **.gitignore**           | A file that tells Git which files/folders to ignore in tracking (e.g., node_modules, .env).                            |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Always write **meaningful commit messages**
- Use **branches** for features and fixes
- Keep `main` or `master` branch clean and stable
- Regularly **pull** changes when working in a team
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing unnecessary files
